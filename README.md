# Ganesha Four

**Ganesha Four** is a two-player connection game inspired by the classic game "Connect Four". The objective is simple: be the first to align four discs in a row—either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—on a 7x6 grid.

## How to Play

1. **Two Players**: Each player takes turns dropping discs into the grid.
2. **Disc Drop**: Players choose a column to drop their disc, which will fall to the lowest available spot in that column.
3. **Winning Condition**: The first player to align four discs in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
4. **Draw**: If the grid is completely filled without any player winning, the game results in a draw.

## Features
- Simple, intuitive gameplay.
- Customizable grid size (you can change the dimensions of the board).
- Easy-to-understand mechanics, perfect for quick and fun gaming sessions.
